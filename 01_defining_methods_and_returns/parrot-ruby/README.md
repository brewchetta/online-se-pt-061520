# Parrot

## Objectives

1.  Define a method that accepts arguments.
2.  Create a default argument.
3.  Practice returning a value.

## Instructions

In this lab you'll be defining a method called `#parrot`.

The `#parrot` method should accept an argument of a string and both `#puts` out
that string _and_ return the string at the end of the method.

The `#parrot` method should have a default argument of `"Squawk!"`.

**Note:** _This lab is explicitly testing your ability to control the return value of a
method, not just what it does, but what it returns. Remember, return values are
important. Ask yourself? what is the return value of `#puts`?_
